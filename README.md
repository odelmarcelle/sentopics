## Installation

A stable version `sentopics` is available on CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("sentopics")
```

The latest development version can be installed from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("odelmarcelle/sentopics") 
```

The development version requires the appropriate tools to compile C++
and Fortran source code.

## Basic usage

Using a sample of press conferences from the European Central Bank, an
LDA model is easily created from a list of tokenized texts. See
<https://quanteda.io> for details on `tokens` input objects and
pre-processing functions.

``` r
library("sentopics")
print(ECB_press_conferences_tokens, 2)
# Tokens consisting of 3,860 documents and 5 docvars.
# 1_1 :
#  [1] "outcome"           "meeting"           "decision"         
#  [4] ""                  "ecb"               "general"          
#  [7] "council"           "governing_council" "executive"        
# [10] "board"             "accordance"        "escb"             
# [ ... and 7 more ]
# 
# 1_2 :
#  [1] ""              "state"         "government"    "member"       
#  [5] "executive"     "board"         "ecb"           "president"    
#  [9] "vice"          "president"     "date"          "establishment"
# [ ... and 13 more ]
# 
# [ reached max_ndoc ... 3,858 more documents ]
set.seed(123)
lda <- LDA(ECB_press_conferences_tokens, K = 3, alpha = .1)
lda <- fit(lda, 100)
lda
# An LDA model with 3 topics. Currently fitted by 100 Gibbs sampling iterations.
# ------------------Useful methods------------------
# fit       :Estimate the model using Gibbs sampling
# topics    :Return the most important topic of each document
# top_words  :Return a data.table with the top words of each topic/sentiment
# plot      :Plot a sunburst chart representing the estimated mixtures
# This message is displayed once per session, unless calling `print(x, extended = TRUE)`
```

There are various way to extract results from the model: it is either
possible to directly access the estimated mixtures from the `lda` object
or to use some helper functions.

``` r
# The document-topic distributions
head(lda$theta) 
#       topic
# doc_id      topic1    topic2      topic3
#    1_1 0.005780347 0.9884393 0.005780347
#    1_2 0.004291845 0.9914163 0.004291845
#    1_3 0.015873016 0.9682540 0.015873016
#    1_4 0.009708738 0.9805825 0.009708738
#    1_5 0.008849558 0.9823009 0.008849558
#    1_6 0.006993007 0.9160839 0.076923077
# The document-topic in a 'long' format & optionally with meta-data
head(melt(lda, include_docvars = FALSE))
#     topic    .id        prob
#    <fctr> <char>       <num>
# 1: topic1    1_1 0.005780347
# 2: topic1    1_2 0.004291845
# 3: topic1    1_3 0.015873016
# 4: topic1    1_4 0.009708738
# 5: topic1    1_5 0.008849558
# 6: topic1    1_6 0.006993007
# The most probable words per topic
top_words(lda, output = "matrix") 
#       topic1        topic2              topic3           
#  [1,] "growth"      "governing_council" "euro_area"      
#  [2,] "annual"      "fiscal"            "economic"       
#  [3,] "rate"        "euro_area"         "growth"         
#  [4,] "price"       "country"           "price"          
#  [5,] "loan"        "growth"            "risk"           
#  [6,] "monetary"    "policy"            "inflation"      
#  [7,] "inflation"   "reform"            "development"    
#  [8,] "euro_area"   "structural"        "price_stability"
#  [9,] "development" "market"            "quarter"        
# [10,] "financial"   "bank"              "outlook"
```

Two visualization are also implemented: `plot_top_words()` display the
most probable words and `plot()` summarize the topic proportions and
their top words.

``` r
plot(lda)
```

After properly incorporating date and sentiment metadata data (if they
are not already present in the `tokens` input), time series functions
allows to study the evolution of topic proportions and related
sentiment.

``` r
sentopics_date(lda)  |> head(2)
#       .id      .date
#    <char>     <Date>
# 1:    1_1 1998-06-09
# 2:    1_2 1998-06-09
sentopics_sentiment(lda) |> head(2)
#       .id  .sentiment
#    <char>       <num>
# 1:    1_1 -0.01470588
# 2:    1_2 -0.02500000
proportion_topics(lda, period = "month") |> head(2)
#                topic1    topic2     topic3
# 1998-06-01 0.04004786 0.9100265 0.04992568
# 1998-07-01 0.17387955 0.7276814 0.09843903
plot_sentiment_breakdown(lda, period = "quarter", rolling_window = 3)
```

## Advanced usage

Feel free to refer to the vignettes of the package for a more extensive
introduction to the features of the package. Because the package is not
yet on CRAN, youâ€™ll have to build the vignettes locally.

``` r
vignette("Basic_usage", package = "sentopics")
vignette("Topical_time_series", package = "sentopics")
```
